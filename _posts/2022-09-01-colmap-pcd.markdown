description: This work introduces a pipeline that aligns asynchronously acquired images with LiDAR point clouds to get localization results with an accurate scale. Experiments on self-collected datasets demonstrates this method is effectiveness and stability in image accumulation. This pipeline enables flexible detail-level adjustments in the reconstruction area, making it suitable for collaborative large-scale scene reconstruction.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
